Highly customizable floating field with admin-page settings for content (including %page_title% tag and default examples), positioning, appearance, and separate desktop/mobile custom CSS with an override option.

**A FleK90 Tool Floating Field (Version 5.6)** is a lightweight WordPress plugin. It adds a fixed-position floating field to your website's front-end. All settings, including content (with dynamic tags and default examples), appearance, positioning, and custom CSS (separate for desktop/mobile with an override option), are managed on the plugin's admin page (**FleK90 > Floating Field Settings**).

Content for the floating field is managed via textareas in the admin settings page (**FleK90 > Floating Field > Settings > Content Settings**). These textareas support HTML, shortcodes, and a special `%page_title%` tag for displaying the current page/post title. Default example content is provided on first use. Positioning uses a 9-point system. Separate custom CSS fields for desktop and mobile allow for fine-tuned styling, and a "Prioritize Custom CSS" option lets custom styles take full precedence over plugin-generated appearance styles.

## Features
- **Customizable Floating Field Content via Admin Settings**: Content for desktop and mobile is managed via textareas on the admin settings page.
  - Supports HTML, shortcodes, and basic PHP snippets.
  - Includes a `%page_title%` dynamic tag to display the current page/post title.
  - Textareas are pre-filled with helpful example content on first use.
- **Separate Desktop & Mobile Content**: Configure distinct content for desktop and mobile views directly in the admin settings.
- **Simplified 9-Point Positioning (Admin Page)**: Control desktop and mobile positions using a selection of 9 predefined locations.
- **Separate Enable/Disable Controls**: Separate 'Enable on Desktop' and 'Enable on Mobile' controls for precise visibility.
- **Customizable Field Width with Unit Selection**: Set the field width and choose units (`px`, `%`, `rem`, `em`, `vw`) via admin settings.
- **Separate Custom CSS for Desktop & Mobile**: Dedicated textareas for adding custom CSS rules for desktop views and mobile views (applied within a `@media (max-width: 768px)` query).
- **Prioritize Custom CSS Option**: A checkbox setting allows users to make their custom CSS take full control over background, font size, and width, ignoring the plugin's settings for these properties.
- **Admin Menu Management**: All settings (enable/disable, content, appearance, positions, custom CSS, CSS override) are managed via **FleK90 > Floating Field Settings**.
- **WordPress Color Picker**: Background color selection now uses the native WordPress color picker.
- **Tabbed Admin Interface**: Settings and 'About' information are now organized in tabs on the 'Floating Field Settings' page.
- **Enhanced Admin UI**: Features a custom black and gold theme for plugin admin pages for a distinct look.
- **Quick Settings Link**: A 'Settings' link is available directly in the plugin list.
- **Content Fallback Logic**: If device-specific content in admin settings is empty, the plugin will attempt to use the content from the other device's admin settings. The `floating-field-content.php` file is no longer the primary fallback for these.
- **Mobile Support**: Displays correctly on mobile devices with responsive styling and content.
- **No Dependencies**: Uses core WordPress APIsâ€”no additional plugins required.
- **Theme Compatibility**: Works with classic and block themes.
- **User Guidance**: Includes a welcome notice and descriptive settings.

## Installation

   - `content-desktop.php` (legacy, content now primarily via admin settings)
   - `content-mobile.php` (legacy, content now primarily via admin settings)

   - `assets/css/flek90-admin-styles.css` (for admin styling)

3. Upload the folder to your WordPress site via FTP or zip it and upload via **Plugins > Add New > Upload Plugin**.

5. After activation, a welcome notice guides you to configure settings under **FleK90 > Floating Field Settings**.

## Usage

### For Installed Users

- **Managing Settings (via Admin Page - FleK90 > Floating Field Settings):**
  - **Enable on Desktop**: Show the field on desktop devices.
  - **Enable on Mobile**: Show the field on mobile devices.
  - **Content Settings**:
    - **Desktop Content**: Enter HTML, shortcodes (e.g., `[your_shortcode]`), or use the `%page_title%` tag. Examples are provided in the textarea on first use.
    - **Mobile Content**: Similar to Desktop Content, but for mobile views.
  - **Position Settings**: Configure "Desktop Position" and "Mobile Position" using dropdowns (9 predefined locations).
  - **Appearance Settings**:
    - **Background Color**: Select using the WordPress color picker.
    - **Font Size**: Set font size in pixels.
    - **Field Width**: Set a numeric value and select the unit (`px`, `%`, `rem`, `em`, `vw`).
    *(Note: Background, Font Size, and Field Width settings are ignored if "Prioritize Custom CSS" is checked).*
  - **Custom CSS Settings**:
    - **Custom CSS for Desktop**: Add CSS rules specifically for desktop views.
    - **Custom CSS for Mobile**: Add CSS rules specifically for mobile views (applied within `@media (max-width: 768px)`).
    - **CSS Override**: Check "Prioritize Custom CSS for Styles" to let your custom CSS take full control over background, font size, and width, overriding the plugin's Appearance Settings for these.
  - Save changes.
- The "About" tab on the settings page provides more information about the plugin's features and usage.
- Visit the front-end to see the field and test responsiveness.
- **Customizing Content (Details):**
  - Content for the floating field is managed via the "Desktop Content" and "Mobile Content" textareas in **FleK90 > Floating Field > Settings > Content Settings**.
  - **Default Examples**: The textareas come pre-filled with helpful examples on first use, demonstrating HTML structure, the `%page_title%` tag, and placeholder shortcodes (e.g., `[current_year_example_shortcode]`).
  - **Dynamic Page Title**: Use the `%page_title%` tag in your content. This tag will be automatically replaced with the current page or post title on the front-end. For archive pages, it displays a relevant archive title.
  - **HTML, Shortcodes, PHP**:
    - You can include any HTML markup directly.
    - WordPress shortcodes (e.g., `[your_gallery]`, `[contact-form-7 id="123" title="Contact form 1"]`) can be used as you would in the WordPress editor.
    - Basic PHP snippets can be used (e.g., `<?php echo date('Y'); ?>`), but ensure they are correct and secure.
    - The content from these textareas is processed by `do_blocks()` and `do_shortcode()` before output and then sanitized using `wp_kses_post`.
  - **Legacy File-Based Content:** Files like `content-desktop.php` are no longer the primary method for content input and are overridden by admin settings.

## Configuration
- **Global Field**: Applies to all pages by default.
- **Content**: Managed via "Desktop Content" and "Mobile Content" textareas in admin settings. Supports HTML, shortcodes, and the `%page_title%` dynamic tag. Default examples are provided.
- **Styling**:
    - Basic appearance (background color, font size, field width) is set via **FleK90 > Floating Field Settings > Appearance Settings**.
    - Advanced styling is achieved using the "Custom CSS for Desktop" and "Custom CSS for Mobile" fields.
    - The "Prioritize Custom CSS for Styles" option allows the custom CSS fields to completely override the plugin's basic appearance settings for background, font size, and width.
- **Positioning**: Configured in admin settings using a 9-point selection system for desktop and mobile.

## Notes
- **Compatibility**: Tested with WordPress 6.0+ and older themes.
- **Performance**: Lightweight with minimal scripts/styles.
- **Security**: Uses `wp_kses_post` for sanitizing content from the admin textareas, `wp_strip_all_tags` for the Custom CSS field, and relevant sanitizers for other settings. If PHP is used in content textareas, its security is the responsibility of the site admin.
- **Debugging**: Logs errors to `debug.log` if WP_DEBUG is enabled. Check the browser console and Elements tab for rendering issues.
- License: GPLv2 or later
- Tested up to: 6.8.1
